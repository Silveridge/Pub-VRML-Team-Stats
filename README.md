# VRML Team Stat Searcher

Displays Team Name, Team Rank (Worldwide), and tier of all the players in your pubs.


**GUI WIP: Only username search works**

**(for now use pubstats.py for pub name searching**

To use GUI:
1. Install pip (https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt (in base directory)
3. python gui.py


If using quest:
 - Put the ip in ip.txt with your quest ip
 - Ensure you have API turned on in settings
 - Make sure you are on the same network as your quest

If using PC:
 - Keep ip.txt as 127.0.0.1
 - Have api on in echo settings

To view VRML team stats of people in your pubs run:
python pubstats.py

To search for VRML team stats from username run: python gui.py *or* python vrmlplayersearcher.py
