# VRML Team Stat Searcher

Displays Team Name, Team Rank (Worldwide), and tier of all the players in your pubs.

---------------------

**GUI WIP: Username search works & pub name searches only partially works**

**(Pub name search output is display in cli)**

To setup GUI:
1. Install pip (https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt (in base directory)
3. python gui.py **OR** double click Run-GUI.bat

---------------------

To view VRML team stats of people in your pubs:
Double click Run-GUI.bat **OR** run python pubstats.py

**You have to have echo open for this to work**


If using quest:
 - Put the ip in ip.txt with your quest ip
 - Ensure you have API turned on in settings
 - Make sure you are on the same network as your quest

If using PC:
 - Keep ip.txt as 127.0.0.1
 - Have api on in echo settings
